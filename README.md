## Name
SAVR - A Recipe Generator
## Description
SAVR is a recipe management Android app designed to help users easily search, filter, and save meals based on their ingredients and cook time. Whether you're a beginner cook or a seasoned foodie, SAVR makes it simple to find inspiration and keep your favorite recipes in one place.

**Features**
- Filter recipes by cook time and ingredients
- Save and favorite recipes for easy access
- Automatically fetch recipe images using the Pexels API
- Clean, user-friendly interface built with Android Studio and Kotlin

**Background**

This app was built as part of a team project to explore real-world Android development. We focused on creating a clean UI, integrating a third-party image API, and solving common UX problems like ingredient filtering.

**Why SAVR?**

Unlike other basic recipe apps, SAVR emphasizes personalization. By letting users filter based on what they already have, it reduces food waste and makes cooking way more convenient.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Requirements:
- Android Studio Electric Eel or newer
- Kotlin 1.8+
- Gradle 8.x
- Emulator or physical Android device
- Internet connection (for fetching images via Pexels API)
- Request our API keys from us

Setup steps:
- Clone the repo
- Open the project in Android Studio
- Add the API keys
- Run the app

## Usage
Once the app is installed and running, here’s how to start using SAVR:

**Searching Recipes**

Use the search bar at the top to find recipes by name or main ingredient.

**Tap "Apply Filters" to filter by:**
- Cook time (using the slider)
- Specific ingredients you have

**Favoriting Recipes**
- Tap the heart icon on any recipe card to save it to your favorites.
- Access your saved recipes via the Favorites tab.

**Image Integration**
- Images are automatically pulled from the Pexels API based on recipe keywords.
- If no image is found, a placeholder will be shown.
