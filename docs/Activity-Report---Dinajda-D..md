Documentation - Completed User Guide - Review\
51 min\
This task was almost the exact same to review as the last one about the system manual. I did all the beginning steps the same and made sure everything worked and was simple to me. I then decided to have my roommate look through the user guide and try to use the app so that I could see if there was any instruction that wasn't landing right on a user that doesn't have anything to do with our project. Though they were a little slow with reading through the guide, they were able to use the app well and had good feedback. Once I was able to confirm that the user guide was correct and useful, I moved this task to the Done column.\

Documentation - Completed System Manual - Review\
47 min\
For this task I had to pull as usual but focus on a file we didn't usually touch until recently. I saw the README.md had lines updated and changed and that there were no changes anywhere else that broke the app. To confirm everything was as it should be, I read through the entire README twice. As I read through it, I used our gitlab and current version of the app to make sure the README was up to date. Once I confirmed everything looked good, I added a comment saying so and moved it to Done.\

Visuals - All Pages Style - Review\
24 min\
First thing I did was pull the latest changes and make sure everything that was supposed to be working actually worked. I looked through the updates and saw the small changes and updates to all the existing pages. I made sure that there were no hidden errors and ran the app in the emulator. After going through every page carefully, I confirmed that there was a consistent style to every page and that nothing stood out as different  or out of place. Then I left a comment under the task saying I was done reviewing.\

Profile - Create account - Review\
38 min\
I first made sure to pull and confirmed that I had every function that was supposed to be working in order. I saw the changes made to many of our project wide files as well as many new files created to support the signup system. By carefully looking over every new change, I was able to confirm there were  no errors in the code. I ran the app in the emulator and tried to create a new account with the same username as the default one Ashni had made. I was able to confirm the app could check and make sure people couldn't use the same usernames through that action. Then I went to create a new account with a unique username and tried to log in with those credentials, which worked. Since I confirmed everything was in working order, I added a comment saying that I was done reviewing under the task.\

Profile - Crop profile pictures - To-Do\
91 min\
I started by pulling all the changes and made sure everything was up to date so that I could start working. This task required me to research a lot because I had never done it before. I ended up following an article's instructions as well as a video. I had to work on the MeActivity.kt and Me.xml as well as many different gradle files and AndroidManifest. I followed everything pretty smoothly but had some trouble with a yalantis function. The article was somewhat confusing and the video helped me realize my issue was that I was putting the implementation in the wrong file. Once I tested the app and everything was working well, I committed my changes.\

Profile - Create profile name - To-Do\
74 min\
I first pulled all the changes and made sure everything was up to date so that I could start working. This task needed a good amount of research. I started with creating a textView and trying to make it so that users could edit it but I found out that wasn't really possible. I had to instead look into editText and how to make that work into looking like a textView but working like an editText. It took reading a lot about editText but I was able to make it work just like I wanted. I was able to make it editable and making it save after the user leaves the page.\

First thing I did was pull the latest changes and make sure everything that was supposed to be working actually worked. I looked through the updates and saw the new files created and the updates to MainActivity.kt. I then checked that there were no hidden errors. Then I ran the app in the emulator and confirmed that there was a new look to the homepage that had animations included. After doing so, I left a comment under the task saying I was done reviewing.\

Profile - Create profile picture - To-Do\
103 min\
As always, I pulled all the changes and made sure everything was up to date so that I could start working. I started by doing what I already knew, which was to add an imageView in the Me.xml page so that there is a profile picture that exists in the page. I also uploaded and added a generic profile picture as a placeholder for the users before they choose their own. Once I ran and tested to make sure that the profile picture showed, I moved on to researching how to make it so that users could press on it and be able to upload images from their device. It took a surprisingly amount of searching and looking through all the results to find something that actually fit what I was looking for. Once I did, I started slowly adding code and running the app to make sure I wasn't breaking it at any point. I only had to add code to AndroidManifest.xml and Me.kt to make it all work. I had made a mistake with a parenthesis in the code which was breaking the imageView itself. It took a while for me to figure out the issue but I was able to fix it and get it working.\

Profile - Link ME page to every other page - To-Do\
52 min\
I first pulled all the changes and made sure everything was up to date so that I could start working. There wasn't any research needed for this task so I got to working on it straight away. To complete this task, I had to go to every kotlin and xml file of all of our other pages. Once there, I had to add the onClick command and link it to the Me.kt page. I had to use the xml files of every page to make sure I was using the correct button ids for all the commands. Once done, I tested and tweaked the code multiple times until everything worked just right.\

Profile - Create ME Page - To-Do\
43 min\
I started with pulling all the changes and made sure everything was up to date so that I could start working. I've already created many pages before this but it had been a while so I quickly looked it up to refresh my memory. I then created a new kotlin file called Me.kt and also created a MeActivity.xml to design the layout of the page. I then linked the two together by adding a setContent function into Me.kt.\

Profile - Create login page - Review\
31 min\
First thing I did was pull the latest changes and make sure everything that was supposed to be working actually worked. I looked through the updates and saw the new files created and checked that there was code with no hidden errors. Then I ran the app in the emulator and confirmed that there was a new login page that worked and sent users to the homepage. Then, I left a comment under the task saying I was done reviewing.\

Filters - Accurate Recipe Pictures - To-Do\
90 min\
I started with pulling all the changes and made sure everything was up to date so that I could start working. I did some research on calling pictures from the API and came to the conclusion that I just had to update what the code calls for. I went though my code and updated it so that the code called for the recipe name and added dish food at the end of it to make sure what showed up was food. About 2 days after I had committed, my group mates let me know they didn't notice an improvement. I checked git and the commit was in here but it was gone from my code and it wouldn't update. That caused me to have to go back and fix the pictures again and committing once more.\

Favorites - Favorites button - Review\
29 min\
First thing I did was pull the latest changes and make sure everything that was supposed to be working actually worked. I checked out the updates in recipes.xml, recipes_item.xml, and Recipes.kt just to be sure there were real changes and no random errors hiding anywhere. I went through each file and confirmed it all looked good. Then I ran the app in the emulator and clicked through every page to double-check that the favorites buttons were showing up on all the recipe cards. Once I saw everything was solid, I dropped a comment under the task saying I was done reviewing.\

Filters - Buttons for filtering - To-Do\
168 min\
This week I went back to working on the filter for the recipe page. I spent some time cleaning up the code from last time just to get back to a working state. I was able to get the spinner to appear and function visually, but I’m still stuck on actually getting it to filter the recipes based on what the user selects. I went through a bunch of different tutorials and tried a few methods for connecting the spinner to the data, but none of them fully worked with how my app is set up. Even though it’s still not doing what it’s supposed to, I’m starting to get a clearer idea of how the filtering should work and what pieces I need to focus on next.

Favorites - Center menu buttons - Review\
22 min\
I first made sure to pull and confirmed that I had every function that was supposed to be working in order. I saw the small changes made in all of the xml files that control the layouts of the pages in our app. By carefully inspecting every changed line, I was able to confirm there were meaningful changes and no errors in the code. I ran the app in the emulator and carefully went through every page to confirm that the menu buttons are centered as good as possible. Once I confirmed everything was in working order, I added a comment saying that I was done reviewing under the task.\

Filters - Buttons for filtering - To-Do\
201 min\
I started working to try and add filters on to the recipe page. I first had to research and find out how I can add a dropdown menu type button in android studio. After looking at some videos, I found that what I was looking for was called a spinner. I looked at multiple articles with tutorials and videos but I wasn't able to get very far. I tried to periodically check to make sure everything was working but I kept getting a bunch of errors and having to switch sources to try something different. Eventually I got a filter button to work but realized I had broken the rest of the code in the process. I decided to stop here for now and try again next week with a clear head as it seemed I was not getting anywhere.

Descriptions - Put pictures on recipe cards - In-Progress\
192 min\
I started off making sure that I had everything pulled and everything ran fine. Once I confirmed I was good to get some work done, I started researching. I hadn't implemented an API like this one before so I had to look at different sites and sources to try and understand how to go about this. I tried to follow multiple websites and videos to be able to do this. The whole process just ended up being a long time of me encountering errors at each step and then having to spend time researching and solving them until I was able to make it work.

Descriptions - Get pictures for the recipes - To-Do\

Because of spring break, I hadn't touched my project for at least a week. I started by looking through my code and running it to make sure everything was working and up to date. Once I confirmed that, I started working on the task I chose for this week. I started searching for different APIs online that would include pictures of different recipes and foods. There were a lot of results and it took a while to look through them all to try and find something that would work but also be free. When I did find one, I got the API key by creating an account and dropping it into our code as a comment for the moment.\

Delete ingredients from search bar - Search Ingredients - To-Do\
120 min\
I first made sure to pull and confirmed that I had every function that was supposed to be working in order. Then I started researching how to delete items from a recyclerview. I found an article from GeeksforGeeks about making an item delete by swiping. I liked the idea so I started following the instructions. I spent the whole time only working on PantryActivity.kt. It didn't take long for me to realize that the method the article described wasn't really working for mine. I couldn't figure out why so I went to chatGPT and asked it why the code I was including from the article wouldn't work with mine. Chat said the issue was that in our code we used a String to keep track and add items to the recyclerview and the method I was following required a data class instead. I decided I'd go through the code I had and switch out the String functions with a data class instead. Once that was done, I was able to continue following the article and change the code to fit what I wanted.

Design recipes page - Recommend Recipes - To-Do\

I first pulled up our Canva design on a separate page as a reference and to make sure I was designing it the way our group had agreed to. Then I went on to add thinks like the right text on the page, colored background, list view for the recipes, and buttons for navigation. I also had to format the constraints for each piece to make sure that they stay at relatively the same position no matter the phone or emulator used. The process just took time and a lot of tweaking small details to get everything right.\

Setting up project

130 minutes 

I worked on finding a software that would work for both IOS and android. Most of the time was spent trying to download and make them work. I tried Flutter on VSCode, Flutter on Android Studio, ReactNative and .NET. I was eventually able to make Flutter work on Android studio and played around with the app (creating a cookie clicker) to get familiar with it.
