Introducing SAVR– Your Personal Recipe Companion!

Ever had a hard time deciding what to cook? As college students, we know how tough it can be to plan meals when you’re short on time and sticking to a budget. That’s why we’re creating SAVR, an app that helps you make the most of what you already have.

Just enter the ingredients you have, and SAVR will generate recipes you can whip up in no time. You can save your favorite recipes to create again and check back on dishes you’ve recently explored. Unlike other apps, SAVR is designed to keep things simple, reduce food waste, and make trying new recipes convenient.

With SAVR, making meals you love is as simple as savoring what you love.
