Descriptions - Formatting Recipe Cards - Review\

So for some reason, unknown to me or my group mates that changes that I committed and pushed last week did not go through, I am unsure of why but on Thursday my group mates tried to pull the changes I commited and nothing was showing and it said that all commits were up to date. So it turns out none of my changes went through and I had to clone the project all over again. So now I had to REDO all of my changes from last time. This includes editing every single .xml file that we have in our project. I had to go through this again and change the background color, font color, font text, button color, heading color, and card color all over again. So this took a significant amount of my time to do all over again, but I was able to finish the entire task.

I edited the recipies.xml and recipies.kt and added the little hearts that are our "favorite buttons" onto the cards. I made them red and changed the hover color as well. I had to edit both of these files to made sure it worked on both front end and backend.

I changed the UI of the entire app. So I basically changed all of the .xml files, changed the background color, font color, and text color. I ran into a few snags with pushing and pulling and so that took a little longer than expected/I wanted. I also had to change the colors of all the buttons, of all the cards + card font. I ran into a lot of issues when it came to pushing my changes, I kept getting error messages and had to stop by the CLC so taking that into account, it took me a while to push these changes as they kept appearing and disappearing.\

I edited the recipe_item.xml file and in this file I rounded out the edges of the recipe cards to make them look a little bit nicer, and cohesive. I also added bigger spaces in between each cards because it seemed a little crowded before. In addition to these things I increased the smaller, greyer, text size by 2 font sizes because it was hard to read. I also changed the flipping mechanism to make the transition from the front to back a little bit nicer and "cooler".\

I worked inside of the recipt_item.xml file where I played around with the fonts on both sides of the cards and tried to find a font that would fit our overall aesthetic of our app. Currently, our app is well developed but the UI looks very off, so I am trying to coordinate everything including the font, background color, highlights, etc so that interface looks nice. During this time I went through a lot of trial and error with importing fonts from google. Android studio has a way to do it in the app but it wasn't working so I tried implementing it into the code itself. Unforutnately, none of my efforts were working, and had to stick with a font style in Android Studio itself, and went from there. The task itself is currently done, but I would like to work on it in the future if we have time. \

#### April 7 - April 13, 2025

#### Issues

I was having a lot of trouble editing my wiki on gitlab, and issues with AndroidStudio glitching and not saving or pushing/committing my code. I went to the CLC on 4/14 and they were able to restart, and fix gitlab and any problems I may have had with that. Unfortunately, because of these problems I lost the changes I had made, and was not able to get much done.

I worked in the recipes.xml page and I added a thick border on the lower page on the recipes page. The boarder spans the tabs on the bottom, and is in a different color than the rest of the page. As we had lab on Thursday, I have not had much time to work on this specific task, and it will remain in progress.

I worked on the activity_pantry.xml and changed the color and the background color. I am working on implementing a grid layout and background but I have not finished that yet. Ashni was having some problems with the API and getting it to connect. So I spent some time researching things and realized we had an extra file called pantry.java, so I deleted that, and it turned out that file was also the problem for her API not working as well.\

Due to technical difficulties our team decided to switch from Flutter to Android Studio. Because of this I had to convert all of the Flutter code in lib/pantry_page.dart to Java. I then created a new page in Android Studio called activity_pantry.xml, and coded in the search bar, and the title onto the top of the page. I pushed my changes to the search-bar branch.\

I downloaded and tested software that could run on both iOS and Android. Most of my time was spent downloading different frameworks and setting them up on my device. I specifically worked with Flutter and React Native, exploring their compatibility and functionality.

I worked with my group to set up a Kanban board, where we mapped out our Sprint 1 goal and broke it down into tasks for everyone to tackle. On top of that, I helped design the appâ€™s interface and different screens on Canva to give the team a clear visual reference.
