**Sprint # 4 Retrospective**

The team charter does not need to be updated. We all communicate and collaborate effectively with each other, and understand when tasks are considered completed. We agree to meet on May 9 at the library, to discuss the next sprint and plan our tasks. We think we could improve on finishing our tasks earlier on in the sprint to avoid having everything pile up right before our sprint review.

Sprint # 5 Goal: Ensure that all tasks of the user story are finished before our sprint review lab.

**Sprint # 3 Retrospective**

Our team charter is working out great so far. Everyone communicates well with each other, and the workflow has been smooth. We’re all clear on when tasks are considered complete, and we’ve been staying on track with our deadlines. But sometimes we do not communicate about when we have finished tasks, which causes tasks to pile up in the Review column since everyone is busy on working their To-Do tasks.

Team Goal for Next Sprint: Avoid letting tasks pile up in the Review column by communicating every other day about tasks that need to be reviewed.

**Planning CI103**

Some of us were confused by what it meant to throw out our project, but with some discussion, we all realized that this would mean starting over. With this realization, we know we do not want to throw out the project we have because we are happy with it and see a lot of potential in it as we continue to add more features. We debated which features we really want to prioritize given the feedback we received on our CI102 presentation, like prioritizing filtering of the recipe results much stronger. Thus, we are planning to incrementally improve our existing code as we go.

We might want to edit some of our existing user stories to be more specific since we are not as confused anymore about what user stories mean. However, we are not yet going to write any new user stories because we want to see what we can accomplish first. We are a little concerned we will not be able to finish everything we would like to during CI103, so prioritization of key features is essential for the success of our team. We are going to delete the user story about recommending recipes that is in our product backlog because we already accomplished this, and it is repetitive with an existing user story. Filtering recipes and being able to save recipes are now user stories that we should prioritize as "must". We can reasonably expect to complete the Descriptions user story this sprint. As several of us agreed during our discussions, we need to complete this user story to be able to complete the user story about filtering the recipe results. We changed the criteria for this Descriptions user story to more accurately reflect the tasks under it, like displaying recipe pictures and enhancing the UI/UX. 

**Update to Team Charter at Beginning of CI 103 (4/3/2025):**  
We are busier this quarter than we were in winter quarter, so we updated our response time requirements and the amount of hours we will devote to the project each week. We updated our calendar to include new dates to meet as a group. We will strategically meet at the end of sprints and when we need to plan our final presentation. Regarding communication criteria and our definition of done, we all feel that these aspects of our team charter are working and will continue to work in CI 103.

**Sprint # 2 Retrospective**

Everything in our team charter is working well. Everyone is able to communicate effectively with all other team members, and we feel that work is progressing smoothly. We all understand when to declare tasks as done, and we are adhering to calendar deadlines effectively.

**Sprint # 1 Retrospective**

The definition of done is working. Everyone understands and agrees when a task is complete or not. Our working agreement looks good and working. We communicate frequently so that we stay on the same page. What isn't working as well is that we're too ambitious and will stick to one task without immediately asking for help for too long. Messages have been working well for communication between everyone. For our next sprint, we're breaking down the tasks into smaller ones.

**Definition of Done**

When the task is successfully accomplished and the aspect it covered works as intended.


- [ ] The task is understood.
- [ ] The task's criteria have to be met.
- [ ] The code is tested and reviewed by another team member.
- [ ] The product owner approves the result.
- [ ] Code is committed successfully.
- [ ] All documentation is up to date.

**Working Agreement**

We work best together when...

- we communicate efficiently and clearly
- everyone is on the same page
- we communicate via text or in person
- we respond to each other within 6 hours
- everyone does a fair share of work
- we learn from our mistakes
- we ask for help when needed

**Communication**

Our main form of communication will be messages for basic communication. We can also use Drexel email when needing to share links or chunks of code. Our latency time period will be no more than 6 hours.
